# ohnoreflow
Oh no! Reflow! is a WebExtension to help front-end Firefox engineers detect uninterruptible reflows in the browser UI.

# Installation

Visit the [docs/](https://mikeconley.github.io/ohnoreflow/) page for installation instructions and links.

# TODO

There's lots to do:
* I want a way of easily filing bugs from the list of reflows that I display
* I want a way of saving and loading reports
