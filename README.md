# ohnoreflow
Oh no! Reflow! is a WebExtension to help front-end Firefox engineers detect uninterruptible reflows in the browser UI.

# Installation

Visit the [docs/](https://mikeconley.github.io/ohnoreflow/) page for installation instructions and links.

# TODO
* Add ability to coalesce similar stacks
* Hide rows if the number of reflowed frames was actually 0 (depends on Reflow API modification)
